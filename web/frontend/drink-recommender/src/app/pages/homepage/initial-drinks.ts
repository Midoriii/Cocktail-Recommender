Four different—and disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass along with triple sec lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat house hazing than one of the world’s most popular cocktails. And yet somehow it works. That’s because the Long Island Iced Tea succeeds where so many of today’s refined cocktails fall short: It’s boozy AF—more than four ounces of alcohol against less than half that amount in mixers. Unless you’re a sailor on shore leave that’s a red-flag ratio rife with morning-after consequences. It’s also precisely what a person needs every now and then.Best then not to intellectualize the Long Island Iced Tea and simply love it for what it is: an easy-gulping one-and-done stiffy. If you’re looking to tame your tea a bit pull back the boozy parts from three-quarter ounce to half-ounce and lean in on the cola. The good people of Long Island won’t be offended. ","HowToMake":"Add all ingredients except the cola into a Collins glass with ice. Top with a splash of the cola and stir briefly. Garnish with a lemon wedge. Serve with a straw.","Ingredients":"Vodka;White rum;Silver tequila;Gin;Triple sec;Simple syrup;Fresh lemon juice;Cola to top","Garnish":"Lemon wedge","Glass":"Collins","Flavor":"Sour;Spirit-forward;Sweet","BaseSpirit":"Gin;Liqueurs;Rum;Tequila;Vodka","CocktailType":"Classics","Preparation":"Stirred","Served":"On the Rocks","Strength":"Strong","Difficulty":"Simple","Hours":"Evening","Occasions":null,"Theme":null,"Brands":"Grey Goose","Id":815},{"Link":"https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pina-colada/","Name":"Piña Colada","Image":"https://cdn.liquor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/13090826/pina-colada-720x720-recipe-260x260.jpg","About":"The Piña Colada gets a bad rap among cocktail connoisseurs. For years it was the poster child of the blender boom a symbol of poolside bars and booze cruises. But the tropical classic—a blend of rum coconut pineapple and lime juice—dates back more than a half century when it was the drink of the day in San Juan Puerto Rico. Our recipe silences the blender blades and instead calls for pebble ice and a nice sturdy shake. ","HowToMake":"Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake vigorously (20-30 seconds).

Was it first dreamed up by a Tijuana bartender in the late-1930s? Or did a Texas socialite invent it 10 years later at her Acapulco villa?Short answer: It doesn’t matter. What matters is that someone somewhere summoned the sacred mixture of tequila lime orange liqueur and sugar and gifted it to the world. Our love affair with the Margarita has endured for more than 70 years even as we’ve often saddled it with our most dubious creative impulses. Chocolate Margarita anyone?Over the years one thing has remained true: The best Margaritas are always the simplest made with fresh ingredients and quality spirits. That means no premade or presweetened mixes. No one has yet to package one that tastes as good as the juice from a newly squeezed lime. That also means using only 100 percent agave tequila.Our Margarita recipe starts there then adds an equal-parts sweetener of orange liqueur and agave syrup. The result is a timeless blend of sweet sour and earthy flavors. Subtle elegant boozy and bold—the perfect cocktail really. It’s easy to see why someone would want to claim it as their own.","HowToMake":"Add the ingredients to a shaker filled with ice and shake.
