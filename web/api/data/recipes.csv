Very slowly and simultaneously pour both coconut milk and citrus over entire surface of punch. Milk will break initially then become cloudy. After 30 minutes a layer of curds should form.

He uses Jerry Thomas’ classic sour template from 1862. In 1922 London barman Robert Vermeire wrote “A few drops of egg improves all sours.” Law followed this suggestion by milk-washing his house-made sour mix. That ingredient also reflects major bartending trends from the past 40 years. He uses freshly squeezed juice—a practice that became common in cocktail bars in the 1990s—to make a sour mix which was a staple of the 1980s. But you don’t need to know any of the history to appreciate the subtle and delicious St. Catherine’s Sound. ,Add all ingredients into a shaker with 3 2-inch ice cubes and shake 6-10 times to chill and aerate the cocktail with minimal dilution.

Allow to sit and curdle for no less than 6 hours. Lastly pour mixture through a mesh strainer several times (use the same milk-curdle-filled strainer) until mixture is relatively clear.

It’s still a mouthwatering trinity of whiskey sugar and bitters. Some argue that it’s the first recorded cocktail recipe dating back to the dawn of the 19th century. It would certainly make the name appropriate. But you’re looking for a cocktail recipe not a history lesson. Start by using a whiskey you enjoy sipping neat or on the rocks; the Old Fashioned isn’t the kind of cocktail that masks the flavor of the spirit. Wild Turkey 101 is an excellent choice for its higher proof and rye content.

And its citrus stock recipe which was conceptualized by co-founder Kelsey Ramage and partner Iain Griffiths alongside Ryan Chetiyawardana in London bar Dandelyan’s juicing room is a simple yet effective 30-minute process of pressure-cooking spent citrus husks (pulp and all) in water then straining and adjusting with acid and sugar to produce a liquid that essentially acts as a juice substitute or volume enhancer. It’s a waste-reduction and resource-doubling technique that offers something the usual suspects (oleo saccharum cordials preserves dehydrating for garnishes and the like) do not. This recipe originally appeared as part of “Repurpose Your Citrus with This Waste-Reducing Hack.”,Add the water and husks to a large pot and let boil for 5 minutes. Remove the husks (your stock will go bitter if you leave any longer) giving a quick squeeze back into the mixture as you pull them out. Remove the liquid from heat quickly and measure. (Accounting for some loss in heat evaporation and absorption from the husks it should be 44 fluid oz give or take). Place back on high heat until liquid is reduced by 50 percent then add the sugar. Add the citric and malic acid according to ratio based on citrus type.*. Remove from heat filter bottle and refrigerate. *Acid ratios by based on citrus varieties: Lemon and lime: 3% citric 2% malic Orange and grapefruit: 2% citric 1% malic Mandarin etc.: 1% citric 2% malic. Note: This recipe can easily be scaled up or down based on how much supply you’re working with or the volume you’re aiming to produce.

This involves heating the spirits by pouring very warm water into one mixing tin then adding the base spirit (in his case bourbon) allspice dram lemon juice and house-made ginger syrup in the other and then nestling it in the first. It’s a sort of double-boiler concept to get the spirits warm and release their aromatics. Then add a little hot water stir and serve. “I had been served so many warm or lukewarm Toddies that I was looking for a way to drink the whole drink hot” says Morgenthaler. “A splash of hot water alone doesn’t result in a hot drink. The bain-marie is our way of getting those ingredients up to temperature. That’s the secret to our Hot Toddy—it’s actually hot.” This recipe originally appeared as part of “The Hot Toddy: Everything You Need to Know to Make a Great One.”,Stir all the ingredients in a bain-marie until warmed through. (If no bain-marie or double-boiler is available pour very warm water into a mixing tin then in a smaller mixing tin add all the ingredients and nestle the smaller tin inside the larger tin until ingredients are warm.).

The Sazerac is what you should drink in New Orleans. One of America’s earliest cocktails the Sazerac is a homegrown New Orleans specialty.

It was a substitution that launched a thousand riffs. In its hundred-year history few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved Negroni. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint. But how do you mix the perfect version? Start by selecting the right base materials. The key to a great Negroni is finding a gin-vermouth pairing that complements rather than overpowers the bitter bold flavors of Campari. Once you zero in on a winning trio write it down memorize it and request it at your favorite bar. You’ll make the count proud.,Add all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled. Strain into a rocks glass filled with large ice cubes.

The combination of sweet sour and spirit is refreshingly tangy and perfect for any occasion.The Daiquiri’s classic cocktail status was long established before the contemporary cocktail phase.

Was it first dreamed up by a Tijuana bartender in the late-1930s? Or did a Texas socialite invent it 10 years later at her Acapulco villa?Short answer: It doesn’t matter. What matters is that someone somewhere summoned the sacred mixture of tequila lime orange liqueur and sugar and gifted it to the world. Our love affair with the Margarita has endured for more than 70 years even as we’ve often saddled it with our most dubious creative impulses. Chocolate Margarita anyone?Over the years one thing has remained true: The best Margaritas are always the simplest made with fresh ingredients and quality spirits. That means no premade or presweetened mixes. No one has yet to package one that tastes as good as the juice from a newly squeezed lime. That also means using only 100 percent agave tequila.Our Margarita recipe starts there then adds an equal-parts sweetener of orange liqueur and agave syrup. The result is a timeless blend of sweet sour and earthy flavors. Subtle elegant boozy and bold—the perfect cocktail really. It’s easy to see why someone would want to claim it as their own.,Add the ingredients to a shaker filled with ice and shake. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass or rocks glass filled with fresh ice. Garnish with a lime wheel.

In addition many brands can be “insipid” she says. While Pegu Club makes ginger beer by the gallon here’s a smaller-scale version to try at home. It takes a little time—note the one-hour wait for the ingredients to fully integrate—but yields enough for several cocktails since only an ounce of this intensely gingery elixir is all that’s needed for maximum piquancy. The recipe does not call for carbonation however. To make it bubbly add sparkling water seltzer or club soda to taste. (Note: Some variations on this recipe call for two ounces of ginger beer when canned versions are used.)This recipe originally appeared as part of “The Secret Weapon That Is Homemade Ginger Beer.”,Makes 1 cup. Add water to a pot and bring to a boil. Stir in the grated ginger. Remove from heat and cover pot. Allow to sit for 1 hour. Strain through a fine chinois (metal strainer) or cheesecloth. (While straining the ginger use a spoon or ladle to firmly press down on the ginger to extract more flavor.) The appearance will be cloudy-don’t worry that’s natural. Add lime juice and brown sugar and let cool. Funnel into a glass bottle. Cap tightly and store in the refrigerator.

The Swedish-born star won her way into people’s hearts with roles in such films as “Torrent” “Flesh and the Devil” and her first talkie “Anna Christie” whose opening line—“Give me a whiskey ginger ale on the side and don’t be stingy baby!”—cemented her legendary status in Hollywood and beyond. So it’s no surprise that someone created a cocktail in her honor. But who invented it and where? Sadly those details have eluded history. What we do know is that famous people often inspire famously delicious drinks and this one’s no exception. Adapted from Knut Sundin’s 1930 book “Two Hundred Selected Drinks” this recipe calls for a delicate mix of BACARDÍ® Carta Blanca rum Cointreau liqueur fresh lime juice and grenadine made silky with a few drops of absinthe. Whiskey and ginger it ain’t. But we think Garbo would love it just the same.  ,Rinse a chilled coupe with 2 dashes of absinthe then discard.

The cocktail was brought to prominence in NYC restauranteur Keith McNally’s Balthazar where it appeared on the menu after being placed on the menu in one of his other establishments. It’s sweet and creamy due to the pineapple juice and Chambord black raspberry liqueur. The primary spirit is vodka though sometimes rum is used instead.This recipe was created by venerable bartender Allen Katz and uses crème de cassis liqueur in lieu of Chambord. This imparts a deeper flavor from the currants that are a bit less sweet than raspberries. So this French Martini tends to be a little more spirit-forward and complex.,Add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.

The cocktail best known for being ordered “shaken not stirred” was invented by none other than Bond author Ian Fleming. The Vesper first appeared in his book “Casino Royale” which was published in 1953 and gets its name from fictional double agent Vesper Lynd.When Bond orders the Vesper it comes with strict instructions that must be followed by any who make it: “Three measures of Gordon’s one of vodka half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?”With respect to 007 shaking a Vesper can result in an overly diluted drink. The golden rule is to always stir a spirit-only drink. And we see no reason to change that here.,Add all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir (or if preparing the Bond way shake).

Combining coffee with Irish whiskey brown sugar and lightly whipped cream Irish Coffee is a hot creamy classic. There are many tall tales about the Irish Coffee’s origins. The most credible version attributes the cocktail to Joe Sheridan the head chef of the restaurant at the Foynes Flying Boat terminal in County Limerick in the early 1940s. Legend has it that when he first served it and was asked if it was Brazilian coffee Sheridan cheekily replied that it was “Irish coffee.” The drink was later made famous by Staton Deplante who worked at the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco during the 1950s. Deplante wrote about the drink frequently in a travel column that was read widely across the States and piqued curiosity about Irish Coffee. ,Filling an Irish Coffee mug with hot water let sit for 2 minutes then discard the water.

The key to the cocktail is to use a smooth scotch that’s not too smoky and freshly squeezed orange juice.

In the roughly 130 years since its inception the granddaddy of rum cocktails has gone from the pride of Havana to an unloved extra on the back of a Señor Frog’s table tent. Even today as the craft cocktail movement reaches full tilt most people too often associate the Daiquiri with adult slushies the stuff of spring break blackouts and mind-splitting hangovers.But in its purest form the Daiquiri is simple and sublime a delicate blend of rum’s sweetness with the raw freshness of sugar and lime juice. Whole lives have been dedicated to balancing the three. That each ingredient should be of the highest quality goes without saying though even then the Daiquiri can throw you a curve. Choose a too-sweet rum and you’re sipping liquid candy; overdo the citrus and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of acidity. Our recipe walks the knife edge with a mix of light rum and a darker demerara sugar syrup. The two bring out the best qualities in each other. One trick when juicing the limes: Use a hand-squeezer (or your own hands). The oils from the rind add an extra flash of intensity that gives the cocktail a nice bright edge.,Add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.

Adding butter to a cocktail may seem a little out of the ordinary but the pat of butter imparts a richness to the Hot Buttered Rum that would otherwise be missing. While many recipes call for a simple pat of butter to be added to the cocktail this version instead calls for butter batter which tends to make it creamier and avoids the oil slick that generally forms on top.While the Hot Buttered Rum dates back to colonial times it was Kenneth Roberts’ 1937 best-seller “Northwest Passage” that reignited the passion for Hot Buttered Rum. The passion warmed the hearts and hands of many a drinker on frosty nights and continues unabated to this date. ,Add the rum and batter to a mug.

The original recipe is attributed to Raffles bartender Ngiam Tong Boon and is a variant on the Gin Sling. Our recipe evokes the classic recipe which is fruit-forward herbaceous and strong though most incarnations of the “classic” Singapore Sling are based on general notes and nostalgia. Later more modern incarnations of the drink created an overly sweet drink based more on grenadine than citrus. The earliest published version of the recipe was in the 1930 classic by Harry Craddock “The Savoy Cocktail Book.” David A. Embury states in his book “The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks” that no two published recipes for the Singapore Sling are the same. What does that mean? The Singapore Sling is a classic and refreshing cocktail that’s fun to experiment with. Our recipe below is as true to the classic as we can get but you should feel free to experiment and come up with your own version. ,Add all the ingredients except the club soda into a shaker with ice and shake.

Combining orange juice and vodka in a highball glass is about as easy as a cocktail gets and creates a base that’s ripe for experimentation.The Screwdriver is a classic drink that has been designated an International Bartender Association official cocktail. The history of the Screwdriver is somewhat debatable even though mention of it in literature goes back to 1949. Some claim that the drink was first made popular by American aviators. Another origin story claims that it was made popular by American oil workers who dubbed the drink the Screwdriver because they mixed it first with a screwdriver when a spoon was not on hand. Make this version of the classic Screwdriver next time you’re hosting a brunch or just need a pick-me-up and rediscover why this is an essential part of any cocktail toolbelt.,Add the vodka into a highball glass over ice.

Combining eggs sugar milk and cream with  bourbon and  rum is the best version of Eggnog. The potency will put a little more cheer in your holidays.Eggnog has a varied and rich history with a lot of competing claims of the origin of the drink that can get lost in an etymological debate. However there are a few things to note. First Eggnog is primarily imbibed in Canada and the USA during the holiday season. It can be consumed hot or cold depending on preference and how cold it is outside. The first printed mention of Eggnog was in 1788 in “The Jersey Journal” that referred to a young man drinking a glass of Eggnog. Second there seems to be solid consensus that Eggnog as we know today is a culinary descendant of Posset.Regardless of the origin everyone can agree that Eggnog is universally delicious. ,Serves 12. In a large bowl beat together the egg yolks and half a cup of sugar until they turn light in color. Stir in the milk heavy cream bourbon and rum. In a separate bowl beat the egg whites with the remaining quarter-cup of sugar until they form soft peaks. Fold about a third of the egg whites into the yolk mixture.

Using a rich simple syrup made of demerara sugar gives the drink necessary sweetness and balance without turning the drink into the sugary mess that many associate with the Daiquiri.The original Daiquiri was invented in the early 1900s but didn’t become popular until the 1940s. World War II rationing made whiskey and vodka hard to come by but President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy made relations with Latin America better and thus rum easily accessible. It was one of six classic cocktails that was later featured in David A. Embury’s 1948 seminal book on cocktails “The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks.”,In a cocktail shaker combine all ingredients with large ice cubes.

It reached its height of popularity in the 1990s when the HBO show “Sex and the City” was at its peak. The pink-hued Martini was a favorite of the characters on the show.According to Gary Regan the original Cosmopolitan was created by South Beach bartender Cheryl Cook. Eager to invent a new cocktail for the Martini glass Cook riffed on the classic Kamikaze using a newly introduced citrus-flavored vodka plus a splash of cranberry juice. There’s some debate about who created the original Cosmopolitan whether it was Cook Dale DeGroff (at New York City’s Rainbow Room) or Toby Cecchini who devised a Cosmo in 1988 during his tenure at NYC’s Odeon. However all agree that Cecchini popularized the vodka-and-cranberry ’Tini.This recipe appeared as part of “Let’s Stop Pretending the Cosmopolitan Is a Terrible Drink.

But this easy-to-make refresher shouldn’t be reserved for only one day a year. This classic cocktail was created in the southern United States during the 18th century and is still a favorite today. The Mint Julep is traditionally served in a Highball glass or silver Julep cup over crushed ice and garnished with mint. Since bourbon is the only liquid in the drink you’ll want to use a high-quality bourbon you know you love.This recipe appeared as part of “The Mint Julep. The Right and Wrong Ways to Make the Simple Classic.”,In a Julep cup or rocks glass lightly muddle the mint and syrup. Add the bourbon and pack tightly with crushed ice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/daiquiri/,Daiquiri Recip,https://cdn.liquor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/23143458/daiquiri-720x720-recipe-260x260.jpg,No drink has suffered more abuse than the Daiquiri. In the roughly 130 years since its inception the granddaddy of rum cocktails has gone from the pride of Havana to an unloved extra on the back of a Señor Frog’s table tent. Even today as the craft cocktail movement reaches full tilt most people too often associate the Daiquiri with adult slushies the stuff of spring break blackouts and mind-splitting hangovers.But in its purest form the Daiquiri is simple and sublime a delicate blend of rum’s sweetness with the raw freshness of sugar and lime juice. Whole lives have been dedicated to balancing the three. That each ingredient should be of the highest quality goes without saying though even then the Daiquiri can throw you a curve. Choose a too-sweet rum and you’re sipping liquid candy; overdo the citrus and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of acidity.

The Mai Tai took a star turn by earning a prominent role in the Elvis film “Blue Hawaii.”The Mai Tai was created as a way to showcase the flavors of good-quality rum. It should never be neon-colored or overly sweet.

Four different—and disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass along with triple sec lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat house hazing than one of the world’s most popular cocktails. And yet somehow it works. That’s because the Long Island Iced Tea succeeds where so many of today’s refined cocktails fall short: It’s boozy AF—more than four ounces of alcohol against less than half that amount in mixers. Unless you’re a sailor on shore leave that’s a red-flag ratio rife with morning-after consequences. It’s also precisely what a person needs every now and then.Best then not to intellectualize the Long Island Iced Tea and simply love it for what it is: an easy-gulping one-and-done stiffy. If you’re looking to tame your tea a bit pull back the boozy parts from three-quarter ounce to half-ounce and lean in on the cola. The good people of Long Island won’t be offended. ,Add all ingredients except the cola into a Collins glass with ice. Top with a splash of the cola and stir briefly. Garnish with a lemon wedge.

The origins of the drink can be traced back to Cuba and the 16th-century Cuban cocktail El Draque named for Sir Francis Drake. Appropriately almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum lime mint and sugar (derived from cane juice) are mixed with soda water to create a refreshing classic cocktail.The Mojito is traditionally served over ice in a highball glass and often associated with summer. Like your cocktails with literary references? You’re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway. While the Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint the end result is a delicious refreshing cocktail that can be enjoyed any time of the year.,Lightly muddle the mint in a shaker.

Hastings Cameron a bartender at several Madison Wisc. bars including Imaginary Bar describes this cocktail tribute to the Green Bay Packers as a “perverse Shamrock shake” in which the mint and fennel of Strega are fortified by similar notes in gin from Death’s Door Spirits a Wisconsin distillery. “I grew up in Chicago rooting for the Packers as a little contrarian” says Cameron. “As an adult I still love blue and orange (mostly orange) but couldn’t possibly care less about the Bears or the Cubs for that matter” he says. While this drink was purely aesthetically inspired by the Packers’ team colors—“Lil Wayne didn’t need anything more than the team’s colors to inspire this” says Cameron—it involves a pretty complex matcha foam evidence of Cameron’s tendency toward molecular gastronomy-like bartending. The booziness of the cocktail is inspired by the ice-cold winters in Wisconsin. “Drink builds tend to swell in volume the farther north we get from Madison. The 2.5 ounces of 80-plus-proof booze is a nod to that cultural imperative” he says.,Add all of the ingredients to a mixing glass with ice and stir. Strain into a coupe express the oil of a lime peel and garnish with the peel. Top with matcha foam. *Matcha foam: Whisk 10 grams matcha with 600 grams hot water.

Combining the tang of lime and the sweetness of orange liqueur with the distinctive strength of tequila our classic Margarita strikes all of the right keys.Although many people reach for premade sour mix we highly recommend using fresh lime juice. The end result is—let’s face it—superior. When talking Margaritas it’s easy to get lost in stories about who invented the drink or get mired in debates over salt versus no salt; blended or frozen; triple sec Cointreau or Grand-Marnier. In our opinion this version is the tried-and-true recipe for the best Margarita you can make. Memorize it and you’ll always impress.,Add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until chilled. Strain into the prepared rocks glass over fresh ice.

It wouldn’t be a cocktail celebrating our Tennessee Titans if it wasn’t made with Mr. Tennessee Whiskey himself Jack Daniel’s. I chose to use its new single-barrel rye whiskey for its heat and spicy notes to give our team the kick it needs to beat the competition and paired it with Chartreuse for which the secret recipe is known only by a select few (hence the playbook).

The idea is to have the vinegar create a really pungent garnish kind of like a pickled onion on a Martini. Fresh berries will lack that zing so I’d definitely suggest pickling them or even just soaking them overnight in Champagne vinegar to at least get some of that flavor.”(As for the name in 1958 the Lions traded quarterback Bobby Layne to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Layne in response supposedly said the Lions would not win for 50 years—though this statement has been disputed as a hoax and was never published at the time. But for the next 50 years the Lions had the worst winning percentage of any NFL team.) ,Add all of the ingredients to a mixing glass with ice and stir until chilled.

The base of the drink is usually a spice mix (cumin black salt ginger mint and fruit powder such as amchoor) sometimes with the addition of muddled dates or tamarind.We took our cues from the latter creating an inspired mocktail with what we had on hand in our pantry. The date gives the drink rich sweetness while the salt and cumin commingle to create a distinct almost shrublike effect. ,Add the date salt cumin and lime juice to a shaker.

Invented on an American naval base in Japan after World War II and made popular during the great reign of vodka of the 1970s and ’80s the Kamikaze isn’t the kind of cocktail bartenders sit around contemplating in hushed reverent tones.In fact it’s not really a cocktail at all. The combination of vodka lime juice and orange liqueur is served ice-cold as a shot and consumed more often than not in less time than it takes to assemble.Which is not to suggest you approach the task haphazardly. The key to mixing a great shooter is to strip out the loose ends and focus on the bold and bracing. Its journey after all is a fast one. This recipe calls for a full two ounces of vodka and fresh lime juice as opposed to sour mix or Rose’s lime cordial neither of which delivers the same tangy bite that gives the Kamikaze its backbone. Be sure to shake thoroughly for at least 10 seconds and double-strain to sift out any ice shards. In the end you’ll have enough for two shots because cutting to the chase is a team sport.,Makes 2 shots. Add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake thoroughly until well-chilled. Double-strain into two shot glasses.,Vodka;Orange liqueur;Fresh lime juice,,Shot glass,Fruity/Citrus-forward;Sour;Sweet,Vodka,Shots,Shaken,Neat/Up,Medium,Medium,Evening,,,Grey Goose

It sprays and it stains even when you're careful so wear an old t-shirt. Pull off the stems and punch out the pits of the cherries with a cherry pitter. Bring to a simmer stirring just until the sugar is dis­solved. Add the spice bundle and continue to simmer for about 5 minutes.	Add the cherries. Using the slotted spoon stir the cherries until they are all soaked in the syrup and are thor­oughly warmed. (You don't want to actually cook the cherries just let them absorb the syrup.) Return the liquid and cherries to a simmer and pour in the brandy rum and bourbon stirring to mix. When the liquid is warmed through remove the pot from the heat. (Be sure not to boil the liquid because you don't want to cook off too much alcohol.)	Using a wide-mouth funnel or jar filler and a slotted spoon pack each canning jar with cherries filling it to the top. Give the jar a good tap on the counter to settle the fruit so there are minimal air gaps. Ladle the hot syrup into the jars up to about half an inch from the rim. Place the flat part of the lid on the jar and screw the band on lightly. Allow them to cool and let the seals form properly. You'll hear a nice pop as the vacuum forms and the lid is sucked down.

Its inventor Norman Jay Hobday an out-of-work Vietnam vet turned saloon owner is also credited with opening the country’s first fern bar a concept that mixed house plants and Tiffany lamps with throngs of upwardly mobile urbanites. Both were an instant hit. And for two-plus decades the Lemon Drop dominated cocktail menus from North Beach to Bangkok hooking a generation of bargoers on its boozy-tart-sweet melange of vodka citrus and sugar. Oprah famously served one to Rachel Ray on her show.Some mislabel the Lemon Drop a Martini. But the drink’s closest cocktail kin is the Crusta a New Orleans invention that dates back to the 1850s and like the Lemon Drop is distinguished by its sugared rim. It’s tempting while whipping up a batch of Lemon Drops to skip this important step. Don’t. That first saccharine brush against the lips before the onrush of orange lime and booze fill your mouth is the Lemon Drop’s calling card. If you don’t believe us just ask Oprah.,Coat the rim of a cocktail glass with sugar and set aside (do this a few minutes ahead of time so the sugar can dry and adhere well to the glass).

Yet for all of its suave simplicity the drink remains as relevant today as it was when it first captured drinkers’ hearts 200 years ago.In truth you could draw a straight line connecting this drink to the first recorded definition of the cocktail category in general (circa 1806) which calls for spirits sugar water and bitters. You could also skip the history lesson and simply make the drink. Do the latter.Start by using good bourbon the rule being that if you wouldn’t sip it by itself it has no place at the helm of a Bourbon Old Fashioned. (There are other whiskey drinks for masking subpar booze—this isn’t one of them.) From there the cocktail-minded seem to break into two camps: simple syrup or muddled sugar. While a barspoon of syrup can cut your prep time in half it robs the drink of some of the weight and texture that makes it so appealing. And anyway what’s the big rush? The Bourbon Old Fashioned isn’t going anywhere. ,Add the sugar bitters and water into a rocks glass and stir until sugar is nearly dissolved. Fill the glass with large ice cubes add the bourbon and gently stir to combine the flavors.

Over the years the whiskey classic has dipped in and out of fashion before finding its footing as one of the cornerstones of the craft cocktail renaissance. Amazingly the drink that socialites tipped to their lips in the 19th century looks and tastes pretty much the same as the one served today at any decent cocktail bar. The Manhattan’s mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth perked up with a few dashes of aromatic bitters is timeless and tasty—the very definition of what a cocktail should be. Early versions call for rye with its spicier edgier profile. Purists claim that it’s not a Manhattan without it but who has ever had fun drinking with a purist? We find that bourbon creates a beautiful if mellower drink. And while Angostura bitters are a must in any variation a single dash of orange bitters helps brighten the cocktail’s edges bringing the whiskey and vermouth together seamlessly. ,Add all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled. Strain into a chilled coupe.

In 2008 it was crowned the official cocktail of New Orleans a designation more suited to marketers than drink mixers. The truth is the Sazerac has always belonged to the Crescent City.Up until the late 1800s it was made with French brandy as a base—Sazerac de Forge et Fils to be exact—before bartenders switched to rye the spirit newly arriving by the barge-load down the Mississippi. A well-made Rye Sazerac is indeed a tasty thing full of spice and depth though perhaps we think a hair too much muscle. Which is why Liquor.com’s house recipe combines equal parts cognac and rye not as a gestural homage to a lost classic but because the two work together so perfectly. The coupling is a boozy yin-yang that when accented by the licorice flavors of absinthe produces a cocktail that’s simultaneously soft and bold smooth and brash and so unmistakably New Orleans. ,Rinse a chilled rocks glass with absinthe discarding any excess and set aside. In a mixing glass muddle the sugar cube water and both bitters. Add the rye and cognac fill with ice and stir until well-chilled. Strain into the prepared glass. Twist a slice of lemon peel over the surface to extract the oils and then discard.,Absinthe to rinse;Sugar cube;Cold water;Peychaud’s bitters;Angostura bitters;Rye whiskey;Cognac,Lemon peel,Rocks,Spirit-forward,Brandy;Cognac;Rye Whiskey,Classics,Stirred,Neat/Up,Strong,Medium,Afternoon;Evening,Mardi Gras,,Angostura;Hennessy;Peychaud's

Its base blend of amaretto sloe gin and SoCo stands in total defiance of what one would expect from a staunch Southern sipper. Yet the drink looms large below the Mason-Dixon line and beyond. Said to have been born at the University of Alabama the Slammer is a go-to at Crimson Tide tailgates where’s it’s often served as a shot. And slamming one back certainly gets the point across. The nutty herbal notes backed by baking spices and citrus come through loud and clear in a single bite. But to truly appreciate the schizophrenia of the Alabama Slammer mix it in a tall glass with lots of ice and freshly squeezed orange juice and allow the mix to dilute for a minute or two. The flavors will loosen up and unfold at a leisurely pace leaving you with a mellower more Southern-tasting drink.,Add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake. Strain into a highball glass over fresh ice.
